# M3C Random Password Generator

## Description

The aim of the project was to create a random password generator to be utilized by employees who have sensitive data; the employees' data will be more secure if it is protected by a password that cannot be reasonably guess. The process has been a good learning experience in terms of learning the workflow of JavaScript. Developing the generator also offered good rehearsal of the content learned the third module of the University of Denver Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp.

## Usage

To use this tool, click on the red, "Generate Password" button. You will be taken through a series of prompts: you will be requested to input the desired length of your password; you will also be prompted to specify which character criteria you would like to include (options: upper-/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters). When all input selections are recorded, a random password that meets your specified criteria will appear in the box, replacing the "Your Secure Password" placeholder text.
